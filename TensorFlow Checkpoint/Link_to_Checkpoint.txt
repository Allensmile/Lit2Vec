Since Github's file size upload limit is 25 mbs, I was not able to upload the checkpoint file here. So instead I have provided a direct Google Drive link to my checkpoint file

The hyperparameters are the same as the one's in the file included in this repository. The number of samples taken and averaged for the input in this checkpoint is 2 (cbow_window =1). I will eventually release checkpoints where the numbers of samples taken and averaged are 3, 4, and 5.

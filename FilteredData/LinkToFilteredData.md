The GoodReadsDataClean.ipynb is a notebook for analyzing and filtering the data, but I included some filtered data below to use if you would like to skip that 
I have some data that's already filtered to use for the Book2VecTraining.ipynb notebook to start training on the data. 

The following are 3 shuffles of data that are filtered to only have ratings at 4 or above, and users who rated at least 15 books. From my limited experience
playing with the data and training, these filtered resulted in the most robust book vectors.
